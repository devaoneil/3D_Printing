# 3D_Printing
Analyzing 3D printed objects  
In this project, I printed 140+ objects, all with the same design. I varied two parameters, the color filament and the layer height, to see if they would affect the mass of the final product and the quality. My analysis (done in R) is provided in the PDF, and my raw data is provided in .csv format.
